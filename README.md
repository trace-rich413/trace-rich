## Now building
- **Map.Py** — scope-aware recon + enumeration orchestrator (evidence-first outputs, per-IP reports)
- **famycom** — NES emulator in Python with GUI + debugger tooling (learning-first; no ROMs)

## What I publish
- Writeups with reproducible steps + impact + fixes (when disclosure allows)
- Tools that improve operator workflow (not auto-exploit frameworks)

## Principles
- Scope & authorization first
- Evidence-first reporting (clean notes, clean artifacts)
- Build > hype (weekly shipped artifacts)
